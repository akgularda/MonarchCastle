## I. GRAND STRATEGY: THE AUTONOMOUS INTELLIGENCE FIRM

**Mission**: To operate a self-driving intelligence consultancy where 90% of operations (Analysis, DevOps, Design) are handled by specialized AI agents, delivering institutional-grade signals at zero marginal cost.

**The "Palantir of Türkiye" Doctrine**:
1.  **Sovereign Data**: Build our own indexes (Inflation, Coup Risk, Sentiment).
2.  **Military aesthetics**: Information is power; present it as such.
3.  **Automated Verify**: AI writes the code, Python verifies the math.

## II. OPERATIONAL PHASING

### PHASE 1: THE FIVE PILLARS (Current Status: 85% Complete)
**Objective**: Establish credibility through 5 distinct intelligence modules.

| Module | Code | Status | Focus |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| **Inflation Intelligence** | `IIA-001` | 🟡 In Progress | Real-time price scraping (Turkey) |
| **Border Threat Index** | `BNTI-002` | 🟢 Active | Geopolitical risk mapping |
| **High Frequency Pizza** | `HFP-003` | 🟡 Pending | Pentagon busyness signals |
| **Sahel Threat Index** | `SRTI-004` | 🟢 Live | RSS-based coup detection |
| **NATO Expenditure** | `NATO-005` | 🟢 Polished | Defense spending visualization |
| **Oil & Baltic** | `OPI/BDI` | 🟢 Live | Global macro indicators |

### PHASE 2: THE AUTONOMOUS ENGINE (Q1 2026)
**Objective**: Hand over daily operations to the Agent Swarm.
- **Orchestration**: Implement `ORCHESTRATION.md` workflows.
- **Quality Gates**: Enforce `QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` automatically.
- **Self-Healing**: Agents detect and fix broken scrapers without human prompt.

### PHASE 3: INSTITUTIONAL MONETIZATION (Q3 2026)
**Objective**: B2B Data Subscriptions.
- **Terminal Access**: $2,000/mo access to raw CSV feeds.
- **Custom Intelligence**: Agents generate bespoke PDF reports for clients.

## III. TACTICAL PRIORITIES (NEXT 30 DAYS)

1.  **Refine Intelligence Feeds**:
    - Ensure SRTI and NATO modules have automated data pipelines.
    - Connect IIA-001 to live Turkish market data.

2.  **Dashboard Unification**:
    - Consolidate all 5 modules into a single "Command Center" dashboard (Next.js/React).
    - Mobile-responsive "Field View".

3.  **Corporate Governance**:
    - Activate the CPO Agent for weekly roadmap reviews.
    - Activate the Security Agent for code scanning.

## IV. RISK VECTORS

### 1. Hallucination Risk
*   **Protocol**: ZERO LLM ARITHMETIC. All numbers must be calculated by Python kernels.
*   **Verification**: Primary source links must be preserved for every data point.

### 2. Platform Dependency
*   **Protocol**: Diversify data sources. RSS > APIs (as per SRTI policy). Local archives for all historical data.
